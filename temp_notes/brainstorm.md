# PIM Implementation
The PIM is a personal information manager that can handle different types of records, such as plain texts, tasks, events, and contacts¹[1]. The PIM works by processing natural language commands from the user and performing the corresponding actions on the records. Here are some examples of how the PIM works with natural language commands:

- To create a new plain text record with the text "Hello world", the user can enter the command `create plain text Hello world`. The PIM will then create a new record of type PlainText with the date and time of creation and the text "Hello world".
- To create a new task record with the description "Finish project" and the deadline "2023-11-25 23:59", the user can enter the command `create task Finish project 2023-11-25 23:59`. The PIM will then create a new record of type Task with the date and time of creation, the description "Finish project", and the deadline "2023-11-25 23:59".
- To create a new event record with the description "Birthday party" and the starting time "2023-12-01 18:00" and the alarm "2023-12-01 17:00", the user can enter the command `create event Birthday party 2023-12-01 18:00 2023-12-01 17:00`. The PIM will then create a new record of type Event with the date and time of creation, the description "Birthday party", the starting time "2023-12-01 18:00", and the alarm "2023-12-01 17:00".
- To create a new contact record with the name "Alice", the address "123 Main Street", and the mobile number "1234567890", the user can enter the command `create contact Alice 123 Main Street 1234567890`. The PIM will then create a new record of type Contact with the date and time of creation, the name "Alice", the address "123 Main Street", and the mobile number "1234567890".
- To modify an existing record, the user can enter the command `modify <id> <field> <value>`, where `<id>` is a unique identifier for each record, `<field>` is one of the fields in that record, and `<value>` is the new value for that field. For example, to change the deadline of a task record with id 1 to "2023-11-30 23:59", the user can enter `modify 1 deadline 2023-11-30 23:59`. The PIM will then update the deadline field of that record to "2023-11-30 23:59".
- To search for records based on criteria, the user can enter the command `search <criterion>`, where `<criterion>` is a condition that involves one or more fields of a record. For example, to search for all plain text records that contain the word "project", the user can enter `search type == PlainText && text contains project`. The PIM will then return all records that match this criterion.
- To print out detailed information about a specific record or all records, the user can enter the command `print <id>` or `print all`, where `<id>` is a unique identifier for each record. For example, to print out all records in the PIM, the user can enter `print all`. The PIM will then display all records with their id, type, date, and other fields.
- To delete a specific record, the user can enter the command `delete <id>`, where `<id>` is a unique identifier for each record. For example, to delete a contact record with id 5, the user can enter `delete 5`. The PIM will then remove that record from its storage.
- To store all records in a file with extension name ".pim", the user can enter the command `store <filename>`, where `<filename>` is a name for that file. For example, to store all records in a file named "mydata.pim", the user can enter `store mydata.pim`. The PIM will then save all records in that file in a format that can be loaded later.
- To load all records from a file with extension name ".pim", the user can enter the command `load <filename>`, where `<filename>` is a name for that file. For example, to load all records from a file named "mydata.pim", the user can enter `load mydata.pim`. The PIM will then read all records from that file and add them to its storage.

# Data Structure
A ".pim" file is a file that stores the personal information records (PIRs) created by the PIM program. It has a specific format that allows the PIM to load and save the PIRs. Here are some examples of how a ".pim" file may look like, based on the user stories in Appendix B:

- Example 1: A ".pim" file that contains one plain text record with the text "Hello world".

```
# This is a .pim file that stores personal information records
# Each record starts with a unique id and a type
# Each record has a date field that indicates the date and time of creation
# Each record may have other fields depending on its type
# The fields are separated by commas

1,PlainText
date,2023-10-01 10:00
text,Hello world
```

- Example 2: A ".pim" file that contains one task record with the description "Finish project" and the deadline "2023-11-25 23:59".

```
# This is a .pim file that stores personal information records
# Each record starts with a unique id and a type
# Each record has a date field that indicates the date and time of creation
# Each record may have other fields depending on its type
# The fields are separated by commas

2,Task
date,2023-10-02 11:00
description,Finish project
deadline,2023-11-25 23:59
```

- Example 3: A ".pim" file that contains one event record with the description "Birthday party", the starting time "2023-12-01 18:00", and the alarm "2023-12-01 17:00".

```
# This is a .pim file that stores personal information records
# Each record starts with a unique id and a type
# Each record has a date field that indicates the date and time of creation
# Each record may have other fields depending on its type
# The fields are separated by commas

3,Event
date,2023-10-03 12:00
description,Birthday party
start_time,2023-12-01 18:00
alarm,2023-12-01 17:00
```

- Example 4: A ".pim" file that contains one contact record with the name "Alice", the address "123 Main Street", and the mobile number "1234567890".

```
# This is a .pim file that stores personal information records
# Each record starts with a unique id and a type
# Each record has a date field that indicates the date and time of creation
# Each record may have other fields depending on its type
# The fields are separated by commas

4,Contact
date,2023-10-04 13:00
name,Alice
address,123 Main Street
mobile_number,1234567890
```
