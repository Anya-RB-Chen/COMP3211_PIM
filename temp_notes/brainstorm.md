# PIM Implementation
The PIM is a personal information manager that can handle different types of records, such as plain texts, tasks, events, and contacts¹[1]. The PIM works by processing natural language commands from the user and performing the corresponding actions on the records. Here are some examples of how the PIM works with natural language commands:

- To create a new plain text record with the text "Hello world", the user can enter the command `create plain text Hello world`. The PIM will then create a new record of type PlainText with the date and time of creation and the text "Hello world".
- To create a new task record with the description "Finish project" and the deadline "2023-11-25 23:59", the user can enter the command `create task Finish project 2023-11-25 23:59`. The PIM will then create a new record of type Task with the date and time of creation, the description "Finish project", and the deadline "2023-11-25 23:59".
- To create a new event record with the description "Birthday party" and the starting time "2023-12-01 18:00" and the alarm "2023-12-01 17:00", the user can enter the command `create event Birthday party 2023-12-01 18:00 2023-12-01 17:00`. The PIM will then create a new record of type Event with the date and time of creation, the description "Birthday party", the starting time "2023-12-01 18:00", and the alarm "2023-12-01 17:00".
- To create a new contact record with the name "Alice", the address "123 Main Street", and the mobile number "1234567890", the user can enter the command `create contact Alice 123 Main Street 1234567890`. The PIM will then create a new record of type Contact with the date and time of creation, the name "Alice", the address "123 Main Street", and the mobile number "1234567890".
- To modify an existing record, the user can enter the command `modify <id> <field> <value>`, where `<id>` is a unique identifier for each record, `<field>` is one of the fields in that record, and `<value>` is the new value for that field. For example, to change the deadline of a task record with id 1 to "2023-11-30 23:59", the user can enter `modify 1 deadline 2023-11-30 23:59`. The PIM will then update the deadline field of that record to "2023-11-30 23:59".
- To search for records based on criteria, the user can enter the command `search <criterion>`, where `<criterion>` is a condition that involves one or more fields of a record. For example, to search for all plain text records that contain the word "project", the user can enter `search type == PlainText && text contains project`. The PIM will then return all records that match this criterion.
- To print out detailed information about a specific record or all records, the user can enter the command `print <id>` or `print all`, where `<id>` is a unique identifier for each record. For example, to print out all records in the PIM, the user can enter `print all`. The PIM will then display all records with their id, type, date, and other fields.
- To delete a specific record, the user can enter the command `delete <id>`, where `<id>` is a unique identifier for each record. For example, to delete a contact record with id 5, the user can enter `delete 5`. The PIM will then remove that record from its storage.
- To store all records in a file with extension name ".pim", the user can enter the command `store <filename>`, where `<filename>` is a name for that file. For example, to store all records in a file named "mydata.pim", the user can enter `store mydata.pim`. The PIM will then save all records in that file in a format that can be loaded later.
- To load all records from a file with extension name ".pim", the user can enter the command `load <filename>`, where `<filename>` is a name for that file. For example, to load all records from a file named "mydata.pim", the user can enter `load mydata.pim`. The PIM will then read all records from that file and add them to its storage.

# Data Structure
A ".pim" file is a file that stores the personal information records (PIRs) created by the PIM program. It has a specific format that allows the PIM to load and save the PIRs. Here are some examples of how a ".pim" file may look like, based on the user stories in Appendix B:

- Example 1: A ".pim" file that contains one plain text record with the text "Hello world".

```
# This is a .pim file that stores personal information records
# Each record starts with a unique id and a type
# Each record has a date field that indicates the date and time of creation
# Each record may have other fields depending on its type
# The fields are separated by commas

1,PlainText,date,2023-10-01 10:00,text,Hello world
```

- Example 2: A ".pim" file that contains one task record with the description "Finish project" and the deadline "2023-11-25 23:59".

```
# This is a .pim file that stores personal information records
# Each record starts with a unique id and a type
# Each record has a date field that indicates the date and time of creation
# Each record may have other fields depending on its type
# The fields are separated by commas

2,Task,date,2023-10-02 11:00,description,Finish project,deadline,2023-11-25 23:59
```

- Example 3: A ".pim" file that contains one event record with the description "Birthday party", the starting time "2023-12-01 18:00", and the alarm "2023-12-01 17:00".

```
# This is a .pim file that stores personal information records
# Each record starts with a unique id and a type
# Each record has a date field that indicates the date and time of creation
# Each record may have other fields depending on its type
# The fields are separated by commas

3,Event,date,2023-10-03 12:00,description,Birthday party,start_time,2023-12-01 18:00,alarm,2023-12-01 17:00
```

- Example 4: A ".pim" file that contains one contact record with the name "Alice", the address "123 Main Street", and the mobile number "1234567890".

```
# This is a .pim file that stores personal information records
# Each record starts with a unique id and a type
# Each record has a date field that indicates the date and time of creation
# Each record may have other fields depending on its type
# The fields are separated by commas

4,Contact,date,2023-10-04 13:00,name,Alice,address,123 Main Street,mobile_number,1234567890
```

# Help function
To write a "help" function to show the manual for a specific function when the user wants to print out the manual for one keyword of method in Python, you can follow these steps:

- Define a dictionary that maps each keyword of method to its corresponding manual. For example, you can write something like this:

```python
manuals = {
    "create": "Create a new PIR of a given type with the given data. The type can be one of PlainText, Task, Event, or Contact. The data depends on the type of PIR. For example, to create a new plain text record with the text 'Hello world', you can enter 'create plain text Hello world'.",
    "modify": "Modify an existing PIR with a given id by changing its field to a new value. The id is a unique identifier for each PIR. The field depends on the type of PIR. For example, to change the deadline of a task record with id 1 to '2023-11-30 23:59', you can enter 'modify 1 deadline 2023-11-30 23:59'.",
    # and so on for other keywords
}
```

- Write a function that takes a keyword as an argument and returns the manual for that keyword if it exists in the dictionary, or an error message if it does not. For example, you can write something like this:

```python
def help(keyword):
    """Return the manual for a given keyword of method."""
    if keyword in manuals:
        return manuals[keyword]
    else:
        return f"Sorry, there is no manual for '{keyword}'. Please enter a valid keyword of method."
```

- Invoke the function when the user enters 'help <keyword>' as a command in the PIM program. For example, if the user enters 'help create', the program will call `help("create")` and display the manual for the 'create' method on the console.

# User Manural

To design the user manual or menu for this command-line-based program, you can follow these steps:

- Write a brief introduction that explains the purpose and features of the PIM program, such as managing different types of personal information records (PIRs) using natural language commands.
- Write a section that describes the installation and setup of the PIM program, such as how to download the source code, how to compile and run the program, and what are the system requirements and dependencies.
- Write a section that explains the basic usage of the PIM program, such as how to enter and execute commands, how to exit the program, and how to get help information.
- Write a section that lists and explains all the supported commands of the PIM program, such as create, modify, search, print, delete, store, and load. For each command, provide the syntax, the description, the parameters, the examples, and the possible errors or exceptions.
- Write a section that describes the types and formats of PIRs that the PIM program can handle, such as plain texts, tasks, events, and contacts. For each type of PIR, provide the fields, the data types, the constraints, and the examples.
- Write a section that explains how to use criteria to search for PIRs based on their types and fields¹[1]. Provide some examples of valid and invalid criteria and their results.
- Write a section that provides some tips and tricks for using the PIM program more effectively and efficiently, such as how to use shortcuts, aliases, or macros for common commands or operations.
- Write a section that acknowledges the sources and references that you used to develop the PIM program, such as libraries, frameworks, tutorials, or articles.

To design the 'help' command for this command-line-based program, you can follow these steps:

- Write a function that takes no arguments and returns a string that contains the help information for the PIM program.
- The help information should include a brief introduction of the PIM program, a summary of all the supported commands with their syntaxes and descriptions, and a reference to the user manual for more details.
- The help information should be formatted with proper indentation and line breaks to improve readability and clarity.
- The function should be invoked when the user enters 'help' as a command in the PIM program.

Here are some examples of how to write the user manual or menu and the 'help' command in Python:

```python
# User manual or menu

"""
Personal Information Manager (PIM)

This is a command-line-based program that allows you to manage different types of personal information records (PIRs) using natural language commands³[3]. You can create, modify, search, print, delete,
store, and load PIRs of four types: plain texts, tasks, events,
and contacts.

Installation and Setup

To use this program, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You also need to download
the source code files from https://github.com/PIM/PIM.git. To run
the program, you can use any Python IDE or simply execute
the command 'python PIMApp.py' in your terminal.

Basic Usage

To use this program, you need to enter commands in natural language following certain syntaxes. Each command should be entered in a single line and terminated by pressing Enter. The program will then process your command and display
the output or error message on the console. To exit
the program, you can enter 'exit' as a command. To get help information about this program,
you can enter 'help' as a command.

Supported Commands

The following commands are supported by this program:

create <type> <data>: Create a new PIR of a given type with
the given data. The type can be one of PlainText,
Task,
Event,
or Contact. The data depends on
the type of PIR. For example,
to create a new plain text record with
the text "Hello world", you can enter 'create plain text Hello world'.

modify <id> <field> <value>: Modify an existing PIR with
a given id by changing its field to a new value. The id is
a unique identifier for each PIR. The field depends on
the type of PIR. For example,
to change
the deadline of a task record with id 1 to "2023-11-30 23:59", you can enter 'modify 1 deadline 2023-11-30 23:59'.

search <criterion>: Search for PIRs that match a given criterion based on their types and fields¹[1]. A criterion is
a condition that involves one or more fields of a PIR. For example,
to search for all plain text records that contain
the word "project", you can enter 'search type == PlainText && text contains project'.

print <id> or print all: Print out detailed information about
a specific PIR with a given id or all PIRs⁴[4]. The id is
a unique identifier for each PIR. For example,
to print out all PIRs in the program, you can enter 'print all'.

delete <id>: Delete a specific PIR with a given id. The id is
a unique identifier for each PIR. For example,
to delete a contact record with id 5, you can enter 'delete 5'.

store <filename>: Store all PIRs in a file with the extension name ".pim"⁵[5]. The filename is
a name for the file. For example,
to store all PIRs in a file named "mydata.pim", you can enter 'store mydata.pim'.

load <filename>: Load all PIRs from a file with the extension name ".pim"⁶[6]. The filename is
a name for the file. For example,
to load all PIRs from a file named "mydata.pim", you can enter 'load mydata.pim'.

For more details about these commands, please refer to the user manual.

Types and Formats of PIRs

This program can handle four types of PIRs: plain texts, tasks, events, and contacts. Each type of PIR has different fields that store different information. Here are the types and formats of PIRs:

PlainText: A plain text record that contains a text. It has two fields: date and text. The date field stores the date and time of creation of the record. The text field stores the text of the record.

Task: A task record that contains a description and a deadline. It has three fields: date, description, and deadline. The date field stores the date and time of creation of the record. The description field stores the description of the task. The deadline field stores the deadline of the task.

Event: An event record that contains a description, a starting time, and an alarm. It has four fields: date, description, start_time, and alarm. The date field stores the date and time of creation of the record. The description field stores the description of the event. The start_time field stores the starting time of the event. The alarm field stores the alarm time of the event.

Contact: A contact record that contains a name, an address, and a mobile number. It has four fields: date, name, address, and mobile_number. The date field stores the date and time of creation of the record. The name field stores the name of the contact. The address field stores the address of the contact. The mobile_number field stores the mobile number of the contact.

How to Use Criteria to Search for PIRs

To search for PIRs based on criteria concerning their types and fields, you need to follow certain syntaxes and rules¹[1]. Here are some examples of how to use criteria to search for PIRs:

- To search for all plain text records that contain
the word "project", you can enter 'search type == PlainText && text contains project'. This criterion means that
the type field of the PIR should be equal to PlainText and
the text field of the PIR should contain
the string "project".
- To search for all task records that have a deadline before "2023-11-30 23:59", you can enter 'search type == Task && deadline < 2023-11-30 23:59'. This criterion means that
the type field of the PIR should be equal to Task and
the deadline field of the PIR should be before
the given point in time.
- To search for all event records that have an alarm after "2023-12-01 17:00" or a starting time after "2023-12-01 18:00", you can enter 'search type == Event && (alarm > 2023-12-01 17:00 || start_time > 2023-12-01 18:00)'. This criterion means that
the type field of the PIR should be equal to Event and either
the alarm field of the PIR should be after
the first given point in time or
the start_time field of the PIR should be after
the second given point in time.
- To search for all contact records that have a name that does not contain "Alice", you can enter 'search type == Contact && !name contains Alice'. This criterion means that
the type field of the PIR should be equal to Contact and
the name field of the PIR should not contain
the string "Alice".

Tips and Tricks

Here are some tips and tricks for using this program more effectively and efficiently:

- You can use shortcuts for some common commands or parameters, such as 'c' for 'create', 'm' for 'modify', 's' for 'search', 'p' for 'print', 'd' for 'delete', 'st' for 'store', 'l' for 'load', 'pt' for 'PlainText', '...
